# DevSnippets

A collection of useful, real-world programming tricks discovered during development—small lines of code or snippets that solve specific problems or enable cool behaviors.

## 🚀 Features

- Fully static website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Client-side full-text search using Lunr.js
- Syntax highlighting with Prism.js
- Responsive design with dark mode
- Copyable code snippets

## 📂 Project Structure

```
devsnippets/
├── index.html              # Homepage with search functionality
├── data.js                 # JSON file containing all code snippets
├── css/
│   └── styles.css          # Main stylesheet
├── js/
│   └── app.js              # Main JavaScript file
├── tricks/                 # Individual trick pages
│   └── detail.html         # Individual trick details page
└── images/                 # Images and favicon
```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. The homepage loads all snippets from `data.js`
2. Lunr.js creates a searchable index from the snippets
3. Users can search through titles, descriptions, and tags
4. Each snippet links to a dedicated page with more details and syntax-highlighted code

## 👥 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can add a new programming trick:

  "code": "// Your code snippet here\nfunction example() {\n  // ...\n}",
  "language": "javascript", // Language for syntax highlighting
  "tags": ["javascript", "utility", "relevant-tags"],
}
```
